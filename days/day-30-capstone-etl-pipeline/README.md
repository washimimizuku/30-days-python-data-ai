# Day 30: Capstone - ETL Pipeline

## 📖 Project Overview
Build a complete Extract-Transform-Load pipeline combining all skills learned.

## Requirements
1. **Extract**: Load data from multiple sources (CSV, JSON, API)
2. **Transform**: Clean, validate, and enrich data
3. **Load**: Save processed data and generate reports
4. **Monitor**: Log progress and handle errors

## Pipeline Architecture
```python
class ETLPipeline:
    def extract(self) -> None
    def transform(self) -> None
    def validate(self) -> bool
    def aggregate(self) -> None
    def load(self, output_dir: str) -> None
    def run(self) -> None
```

## Features to Implement
- Multi-source data extraction
- Data cleaning and validation
- Outlier detection
- Statistical analysis
- Grouping and aggregation
- JSON report generation
- Error handling and logging

## Success Criteria
- All data sources processed
- Data quality validated
- Statistics calculated
- Reports generated
- Pipeline runs end-to-end

## 💻 Implementation
Complete `exercise.py`
