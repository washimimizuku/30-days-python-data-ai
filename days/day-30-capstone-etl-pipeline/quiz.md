# Day 30 Quiz: Capstone ETL Pipeline

## Questions

### 1. What does ETL stand for?

**Your answer:**


**Correct answer:** Extract, Transform, Load. ETL is a data integration process: Extract data from sources, Transform/clean it, Load to destination. It's fundamental to data engineering.

---

### 2. What are the key steps in an ETL pipeline?

**Your answer:**


**Correct answer:** 1) Extract from sources (CSV, JSON, APIs, databases), 2) Transform (clean, validate, aggregate), 3) Load to destination (database, file, data warehouse), 4) Monitor and log.

### 3. Why is data validation important in ETL?

**Your answer:**


**Correct answer:** Validation ensures data quality, catches errors early, prevents bad data from corrupting downstream systems, and maintains data integrity throughout the pipeline.

---

### 4. How do you handle errors in ETL pipelines?

**Your answer:**


**Correct answer:** Use try-except blocks, log errors, implement retry logic, validate data at each step, have rollback mechanisms, and alert on failures. Never silently fail.

---

### 5. What makes a good ETL pipeline?

**Your answer:**


**Correct answer:** Good pipelines are: idempotent (can rerun safely), monitored (logging/alerts), scalable (handles growing data), maintainable (clear code), tested, and documented.
