# 30 Days of Python for Data and AI

A focused 30-day program (1 hour/day) to learn Python specifically for Data Engineering and AI projects.

## Overview

**Duration**: 30 days, ~1 hour/day (35-40 hours total)  
**Prerequisites**: None - starts from basics  
**Outcome**: Python skills for data engineering and AI projects

> **Note**: Most days take 1 hour, but project days (10, 20, 30) may take 1.5-2 hours. Learn at your own pace!

**What's Included**:
- 📚 30 comprehensive lessons
- 💻 90+ hands-on exercises
- ✅ 150+ quiz questions
- 🎯 3 major projects (Days 10, 20, 30)
- 📊 Real-world data engineering scenarios

## What You'll Learn

### Core Python (Days 1-10)
- Variables, data types, operators
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Functions and modules
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- File I/O
- Error handling
- Object-oriented programming basics

### Data-Focused Python (Days 11-20)
- NumPy for numerical computing
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Working with CSV and JSON
- DateTime handling
- Regular expressions
- List comprehensions and generators

### AI/ML Python (Days 21-30)
- Virtual environments and package management (pip, uv, poetry)
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive computing
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Working with APIs (requests library)
- Async programming with asyncio
- Type hints and Pydantic for data validation
- Testing with pytest
- Building complete ETL pipelines

---

## Daily Structure

**Regular Days** (1 hour):
- **� Conceipt** (15 min) - Theory and examples
- **💻 Exercise** (40 min) - Hands-on coding
- **✅ Quiz** (5 min) - Test understanding

**Project Days** (1.5-2 hours):
- Days 10, 20, 30 are mini-projects requiring more time
- Take your time - quality over speed!

---

## Projects

- Day 10: **Mini Project** - Data file processor
- Day 20: **Mini Project** - Data analysis tool
- Day 30: **Capstone** - ETL pipeline

---

## After Completion

You'll be ready for:
✅ 100 Days of Data and AI bootcamp
✅ Python-based data engineering projects
✅ Data manipulation and analysis with pandas
✅ Building ETL pipelines
✅ Working with APIs (consuming, not building)
✅ Further learning in web frameworks (FastAPI, Flask)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start (5 minutes)

1. **Install Python 3.11+**
2. **Download** this repository
3. **Install packages**: `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib requests`
4. **Verify setup**: `python resources/test_setup.py`
5. **Start learning**: Open `days/day-01-variables-and-data-types/README.md`

👉 **See [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions**

### Additional Resources

- 📖 **Detailed Setup**: [resources/SETUP.md](./resources/SETUP.md)
- 📝 **Quick Reference**: [resources/cheatsheet.md](./resources/cheatsheet.md)
- 📚 **Curriculum**: [CURRICULUM.md](./CURRICULUM.md)

## 📖 How to Use Each Day

1. **Read** the lesson (README.md) - 15 minutes
2. **Code** the exercises (exercise.py) - 40 minutes
3. **Check** solutions if stuck (solution.py)
4. **Quiz** yourself (quiz.md) - 5 minutes

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Code along** with examples - don't just read
- **Type out solutions** - don't copy-paste
- **Take your time** - especially on project days (10, 20, 30)
- **Take breaks** - it's okay to split a day across multiple sessions
- **Practice more** - build small projects to reinforce learning
- **Ask questions** - use community resources when stuck
