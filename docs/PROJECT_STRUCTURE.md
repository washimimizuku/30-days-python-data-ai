## 📚 Core Files

### README.md
Main project documentation including:
- Overview and learning objectives
- What you'll learn (Core Python, Data-Focused, AI/ML)
- Daily structure (Concept, Exercise, Quiz)
- Getting started guide
- Tips for success

### CURRICULUM.md
Week-by-week breakdown:
- Week 1: Python Fundamentals (Days 1-7)
- Week 2: Intermediate Python (Days 8-14)
- Week 3: Data-Focused Python (Days 15-21)
- Week 4: Advanced & AI-Ready (Days 22-30)

### requirements.txt
Python packages needed:
- pandas, numpy (data manipulation)
- matplotlib (visualization)
- requests (API calls)
- pytest (testing)
- pydantic (data validation)

## 📖 Daily Lesson Structure

Each day contains 4 files:

1. **README.md** (50-200+ lines)
   - Learning objectives
   - Theory with code examples
   - Best practices
   - Exercise references
   - Tomorrow preview

2. **exercise.py**
   - 5+ hands-on exercises
   - TODO comments for guidance
   - Progressive difficulty
   - Real-world scenarios

3. **solution.py**
   - Complete working solutions
   - Explanatory comments
   - Best practices demonstrated
   - Runnable code

4. **quiz.md**
   - 5-6 questions
   - Answer key included
   - Self-assessment guidance
   - Next steps recommendations

## 🎯 Key Features

### Three Major Projects
- **Day 10**: Data File Processor (CSV validation, cleaning, JSON export)
- **Day 20**: Data Analysis Tool (complete analysis pipeline)
- **Day 30**: ETL Pipeline (extract, transform, load with validation)

### Progressive Learning
- Starts with basics (variables, data types)
- Builds to intermediate (OOP, file I/O)
- Advances to data tools (NumPy, Pandas)
- Culminates in real projects (ETL pipeline)

### Data Engineering Focus
- Sensor data examples throughout
- Real-world scenarios
- ETL pipeline development
- Data validation and cleaning
- API integration

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Read `README.md` for overview
2. Check `docs/SETUP.md` for installation
3. Run `python tools/test_setup.py` to verify setup
4. Start with `days/day-01-variables-and-data-types/README.md`
5. Complete exercises, check solutions, take quiz
6. Move to next day

## ✅ Quality Standards

All content verified for:
- Comprehensive lessons (50-200+ lines per README)
- Working code examples
- Hands-on exercises
- Complete solutions
- Knowledge checks
- Consistent formatting
- Professional quality

## 📊 Statistics
